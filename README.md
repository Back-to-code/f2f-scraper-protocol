# Scraper

This repo describes how a scraper should work and gives helper libaries for building a scraper

- [Open API Spec](./openapi.yaml) *(scraper should implement this and is implemented by the libaries under here)*
- [GoLang lib](./README_go.md)
- [Deno lib](./README_deno.md)

## Why is this repo public?

This makes it a lot easier to use this as a library in other project.

But keep that also in mind when adding new features
